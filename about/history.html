      <h2>Where did i come from</h2>
      <div class="text-justify">
        <p>
          Once upon a time, in a small town nestled in the rolling hills of
          France, there lived a young and ambitious student named Baptiste. He
          was a spirited and determined individual, known throughout his
          community for his passion for sports and his unyielding dedication to
          his studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baptiste's love for sports was evident from a very young age. As a
          child, he would spend countless hours kicking a soccer ball around the
          local park or challenging his friends to impromptu races down the
          tree-lined streets. His parents, who had always encouraged his
          enthusiasm for physical activities, recognized his potential early on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up, Baptiste's energy and enthusiasm for sports were matched
          only by his discipline and commitment to his academic pursuits. He
          excelled in his studies, earning top grades in school. His teachers
          often praised his strong work ethic and his ability to balance his
          schoolwork with his passion for sports.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he reached high school, Baptiste faced a turning point. He
          realized that he wanted to take his love for sports to the next level.
          He aspired to become not just a student but also an athlete. He began
          to train rigorously, focusing on a variety of sports like soccer,
          track and field, and even tennis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through hard work and dedication, Baptiste made a name for himself in
          local sports circles. He was an exceptional athlete, and his natural
          talent, combined with his unwavering determination, attracted the
          attention of coaches and scouts. Soon, he was competing in regional
          and national events, representing his town and school with pride.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baptiste's journey wasn't without challenges. He faced setbacks,
          injuries, and moments of self-doubt. However, he used each obstacle as
          an opportunity to learn, grow, and become a better athlete and
          student. His perseverance and resilience were his greatest allies in
          the face of adversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Baptiste continued to excel in both sports and academics,
          universities took notice. His hard work paid off when he received
          athletic scholarships from several prestigious institutions. Baptiste
          faced a tough decision - choosing between pursuing his athletic dreams
          and his academic goals.
